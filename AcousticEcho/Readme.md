# Matlab Acoustic Demo

This project is an adaptation of the demo from Matlab showing the
effectiveness of an acoustic echo canceler.  It has been modified from
the original demo located here:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/examples/acoustic-echo-cancellation-aec.html
in that the code has been put into re-usable functions, and additional echo cancelers
have been added.
